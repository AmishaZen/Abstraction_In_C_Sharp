# Abstraction_In_C_Sharp
See how Abstraction and inheritance works by the example of geometry Shape.

## Problem Statement of Geometry shape 

# Part 1:

# Create an abstract class Quadrilateral which has a data member length & abstract method area.

    # Create two derived classes Square and Rectangle. 
    # Square class shall have no data member. Give implementation of area method.
    # Rectangle class shall have data member called Breadth. Give implementation of area method.
    # In the main program create Rectangle object and Square object.
    # Make use of only constructors to create the objects & initializing length of Square to 4 & that of rectangle set length to 5 & Breadth to
    # Compare the two areas & display appropriate message.
    # (E.g.: Square area is greater than Rectangle area)

# Part 2:
    # Create a property IsSquare in rectangle class which returns a true when the given Rectangle is a Square. Show itâ€™s usage in mail program.

# Part 3:
    # Create one method as Perimeter for both Square and Rectangle Classes which will calculate perimeter for Square and rectangle.
